# Hide FB Chat - WebExtension 

A simple WebExtension for Firefox 

## What does it do?
- Hides the chat from Facebook (chat dialogs and the buddylist)
- Replaces the Messages button with a link to messenger.com

## Why?
I dont want to be distracted by chat dialogs when I am wasting my life browsing Facebook.

Some people want the Messenger to be separated from Facebook.

## Where?
https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/hide-facebook-chat/

## Warning!
This add-on modifies the Facebook webpage based on HTML element id:s. If Facebook at some point of time changes those id:s this add-on will not work properly.
